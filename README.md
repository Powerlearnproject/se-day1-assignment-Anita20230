#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is an approach that helps design, develop, test and maintain software. It helps in ensuring the software products are reliable and meets the user needs, leads to more efficicent systems, facilitates easy maintenance and scalability for future enhancements and are cost effective.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  In the 1940s - 1950s where programming languages like FORTRAN and COBOL were developed.
  In the 1950s - 1960s, the waterfall model was introduced which was linear and sequential approach to software development with phases like requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
  In the 1960s, the NATO Conference came up with the the term "Software Engineering," to address the "software crisis" of unreliable and expensive software.
  In the 1990s there was emergence of Agile Manifesto and Agile Methodologies which introduced flexible and iterative development processes.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Planning: involves identifying the project scope, resources, budget, and timeline.
  Requirement Analysis: gathering and documenting user and system requirements.
  Design and prototype: creating architecture and detailed design of the system.
  Development: writing the source code according to design specifications.
  Testing: verifying and validating the software to ensure it meets requirements and is bug-free.
  Deployment: releasing the software to users.
  Maintenance: providing ongoing support, bug fixes, and updates.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  The waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach where each phase depends on the deliverables of the previous phase. It allows for clear documentation and well-defined stages.
  The agile methodology is an incremental approach that focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback ideal for mobile app development and startups. This methodology is adaptable to changes and encourages continuous feedback and improvement.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  A software developer helps to write and maintain source code, collaborate with designers and testers and debug and troubleshoot software issues.
  A quality assurance (QA) engineer helps to design and execute test cases, ensure the software meets quality standards and report and track defects.
  A project manager helps to plan and manage project timelines, budget, and resources, communicate with clients and stakeholders and ensure the project meets requirements.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for software development, including a code editor, debugger, and compiler which improves productivity. Examples include IntelliJ IDEA, and VS Code.
  Version Control Systems (VCS) helps to facilitate collaboration among developers, version tracking, and rollback to previous versions. Examples include Git, GitHub, and Bitbucket.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Uncontrolled changes in a project's scope which can be solved by implementing clear requirements, change control processes, and regular communication with stakeholders.
  Accumulation of suboptimal code due to rushed development which can be solved by refactoring code and adhering to coding standards and best practices.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit testing involves testing individual components or units of code. It ensures that each part of the application works correctly in isolation.
  Integration testing involves interactions between integrated units or modules. It helps to verify the correct communication between components.
  System testing involves testing the complete system as a whole. It helps to ensure that the system meets the specified requirements.
  Acceptance testing deals with validating the software against user requirements. It is involved with confirming that the system is ready for delivery and meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering involves crafting questions or statements to effectively communicate with AI models, guiding them to produce accurate and relevant outputs.
  It helps to ensure that the AI responses are relevant, usable, effective accurate, and context-appropriate.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  The vague prompt: 
  â€œTell me more about the benefits of practicing yoga to the health."
  This prompt is ambiguous and lacks focus, leading to a broad and unfocused response.
  The improved prompt: 
  "Explain the psychological and physical health benefits of regular yoga practices in young adults."
  This prompt focuses on the psychological and physical health benefits specifically in young adults.
